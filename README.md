# Translation scripts
Python scripts for LLM machine translation

`translate_benchmarking.py`: This is for benchmarking the translation capability of base LLMs such as Poro, Viking, Mistral, Llama, etc., using a few-shot prompt. Translation examples in the prompt are randomly selected from the dev sets of FLORES-101 and Tatoeba. 

`translate_datasets.py`: This is for translating SFT and DPO datasets using Poro and Viking.
